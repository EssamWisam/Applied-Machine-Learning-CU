 <h2> ðŸ“· Image Processing Tutorials </h2>
<br>
  
Recognizing that many students lacked prior experience in image processing, an optional tutorial session was offered. This session focused on core image processing concepts derived from the course material, with a strong emphasis on hands-on practice and familiarization with image processing toolboxes.

âœ¦ The series of tutorials cover the following using toolboxes such as OpenCV an Scikit-image:

  - Understanding and reading images with different toolboxes and related data structures/basic image features
  - Preprocessing images (greyscaling, contrast, equalization, thresholding, convolution, blur, edge detection, etc.)
  - Murphological methods (erosion, dilation, opening, closing, etc.)
  - Segmentation methods and object detection (clustering, region merging, hough transforms, etc.)
  - Texture analysis techniques (Local Binary Pattern, GLCM features, etc.)
  - Interest point detection (Harris Corner Detection, SIFT)
