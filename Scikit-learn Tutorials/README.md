‚ú¶ In this series of tutorials we cover with students a comprehensive overview of the most widely used package in classical machine learning: Scikit-learn. Different major submodules are explored in the tutorials as shown:

All modules shown are covered except those in grey. In this, students learn how to implement various elements in the machine learning cycle:

‚ú¶ This includes many basic and *advanced* machine learning engineering concepts including:

- Supervised, Semi-supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- Loading data, generating data as well as normalization and encoding methods
- Key machine learning metrics and different techniques for cross validation
- Learning curves, validation curves and different hyperparameter tuning techniques as well as logging
- Feature extraction, selection and visualization techniques
- Pipelines and column transformer (crucial topics often overlooked)
- Generalizing models to multiclass or multioutputs and probability calibration
- Deploying Scikit models with FastAPI and generating API docs

In this, many machine learning models covered in the lecture but not the lab assignments are demonstrated and analyzed along the way for comprehensiveness.
