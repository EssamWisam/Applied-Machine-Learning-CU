## üìÖ Modus Operandi
Tutorials are held weekly on-campus, with each session lasting three contact hours with a total of about 14 tutorials per semester. They are designed to bridge the theoretical knowledge from the lecture to practice and provide real hands-on experience to students.

**Tutorials involve the following types of activities:**

  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> Engineering Project </td>

  <h2> üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Python Tutorials </h2>
</summary>
<br>
  
‚ú¶ In this series of tutorials we cover with students a comprehensive introduction to Python which makes use of their existing knowledge of C++ and covers:
  - PyThon basics, Types and Operators
  - Control Flow, Functions, OOP, Exceptions and Files

‚ú¶ By virtue of being comprensive, these also include advanced or sophisticated topics such as: 
- Type hints

- Einsum
- Etc.

See the `Python Tutorials` folder to check out the tutorials.

  <h2> üçä Scikit-learn Tutorials </h2>
</summary>
<br>
  
‚ú¶ In this series of tutorials we cover with students a comprehensive overview of the most widely used package in classical machine learning: Scikit-learn. Different major submodules are explored in the tutorials as shown:


<img width="1025" alt="image" src="https://github.com/EssamWisam/Applied-Machine-Learning-CU/assets/49572294/2966feea-80ef-4b00-b0e0-ab8dd17a3af7">

All modules shown are covered except those in grey. In this, students learn how to implement various elements in the machine learning cycle:

‚ú¶ This includes many basic and *advanced* machine learning engineering concepts including:

- Supervised, Semi-supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- Loading data, generating data as well as normalization and encoding methods
- Key machine learning metrics and different techniques for cross validation
- Learning curves, validation curves and different hyperparameter tuning techniques as well as logging
- Feature extraction, selection and visualization techniques
- Pipelines and column transformer (crucial topics often overlooked)
- Generalizing models to multiclass or multioutputs and probability calibration
- Deploying Scikit models with FastAPI and generating API docs

In this, many machine learning models covered in the lecture but not the lab assignments are demonstrated and analyzed along the way for comprehensiveness.

  <h2> üì∑ Image Processing Tutorials </h2>

<br>
  
Recognizing that many students lacked prior experience in image processing, an optional tutorial session was offered. This session focused on core image processing concepts derived from the course material, with a strong emphasis on hands-on practice and familiarization with image processing toolboxes.

‚ú¶ The series of tutorials cover the following using toolboxes such as OpenCV an Scikit-image:

  - Understanding and reading images with different toolboxes and related data structures/basic image features
  - Preprocessing images (greyscaling, contrast, equalization, thresholding, convolution, blur, edge detection, etc.)
  - Murphological methods (erosion, dilation, opening, closing, etc.)
  - Segmentation methods and object detection (clustering, region merging, hough transforms, etc.)
  - Texture analysis techniques (Local Binary Pattern, GLCM features, etc.)
  - Interest point detection (Harris Corner Detection, SIFT)

  <h2> üöÄ PyTorch Tutorials </h2>

<br>
  
It was essential to familiarize students with deep learning frameworks and techniques because deep learning is a main component of this course. The main framework chosen for this was PyTorch.

‚ú¶ Students are first introduced to the deep learning cycle and the need of deep learning frameworks is motivated:

Afterwards, PyTorch is broken down and then its main components are covered in a similar fashion to Scikit-learn:

**This includes the following topics:**

- PyTorch base functionality as a tensor processing package that is capable of automatic differentation and runs on the GPU 
- Implementing simple networks (linear and logistic regression) using only base functionality from PyTorch
- Dataloaders and datasets in PyTorch (as well as illustrating the need for `torchvision`, `torchaudio` and `torchtext`)
- Optimizers and schedulers in PyTorch
- Layers, loss functions and activations in PyTorch (including creating custom layers)
- Feedforward Neural Network on MNIST project
- Convolutional Neural Network on Hymenoptra (including fine-tuning)

  <h2> üí• TensorFlow and Keras Tutorials </h2>

This was presented as optional material for students willing to go beyond PyTorch, since in the industry it's common for corps to prefer only one over the other. We only briefly went over the material in the tutorial, contrary to PyTorch.

TensorFlow is broken down into main components:

  <h2> ‚öóÔ∏è Lab Topics </h2>
</summary>
<br>
  
This section is only meant to further motivate you to take the course (i.e., labs will remain inaccessible). There are generally about six or seven labs where one lab typically takes the following form:
  
- Implementing machine learning technique(s) from scratch with OOP
- Testing the implementation by comparing to actual implementations from libraries
- Analyzing hyperparameter or properties of the technique (and comparing it with others when applicable)
- Using the technique over a real dataset in a full pipeline

Here are some lab highlights:
