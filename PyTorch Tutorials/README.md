It was essential to familiarize students with deep learning frameworks and techniques because deep learning is a main component of this course. The main framework chosen for this was PyTorch.

âœ¦ Students are first introduced to the deep learning cycle and the need of deep learning frameworks is motivated:

Afterwards, PyTorch is broken down and then its main components are covered in a similar fashion to Scikit-learn:

**This includes the following topics:**

- PyTorch base functionality as a tensor processing package that is capable of automatic differentation and runs on the GPU 
- Implementing simple networks (linear and logistic regression) using only base functionality from PyTorch
- Dataloaders and datasets in PyTorch (as well as illustrating the need for `torchvision`, `torchaudio` and `torchtext`)
- Optimizers and schedulers in PyTorch
- Layers, loss functions and activations in PyTorch (including creating custom layers)
- Feedforward Neural Network on MNIST project
- Convolutional Neural Network on Hymenoptra (including fine-tuning)
- Spam SMS classifications with many-to-one RNNs
