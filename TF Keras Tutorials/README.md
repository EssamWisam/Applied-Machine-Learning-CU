  <h2> ðŸ’¥ TensorFlow and Keras Tutorials </h2>
<br>

This was presented as optional material for students willing to go beyond PyTorch, since in the industry it's common for corps to prefer only one over the other. We only briefly went over the material in the tutorial, contrary to PyTorch.

TensorFlow is broken down into main components:

Then Keras as well:

**This includes the following topics:**
- TensorFlow base functionality as a tensor processing package that is capable of automatic differentation and runs on the GPU
- TensorFlow VS. PyTorch discussion
- Loading and operating on data in TensorFlow
- High-level loading of data in Keras and using built-in datasets
- Layers (including custom ones) and loss functions in Keras
- Optimizers and schedulers in Keras
- Metrics in Keras
- KerasCV and KerasNLP Intro
- Sequential, Functional and Subclassing approaches to define models
- Callbacks in Keras
- Training and evaluating models at three different levels of abstractions
- Keras Ops and using PyTorch/Jax with Keras
- Feedforward Neural Network on MNIST project
- Convolutional Neural Network on Hymenoptra (including fine-tuning)
- Basic RNN use example
